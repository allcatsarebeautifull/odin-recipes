<h2>Description</h2>

Crisp on the outside, moist and buttery on the inside, these Blueberry Scones are bursting with flavor. Fresh blueberries and lemon zest mixed into the dough makes each bite taste like sunshine! These scones are baked to perfection and are a delicious addition to any breakfast or brunch.

<p>
Perfect for any occasion, these blueberry scones are a crowdpleaser. These scones are so soft, flaky, and tender that they won’t last long once you pull them out of the oven. I love how these scones melt in your mouth. They are a breeze to make with pantry staples, so you can skip the frantic grocery run early in the morning if you’re craving scones for brunch.

The best part about these scones is that you don’t need any special equipment to make them. All you need is a bowl to hand-mix all the ingredients together, and you’re good to go! </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>240g all purpose flour</li>
    <li>66g sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>113g cold unsalted butter</li>
    <li>170g blueberries</li>
    <li>zest of 1 lemon</li>
    <li>180ml heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add butter and work into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or by pressing the pieces between your fingers until they are about the size of peas. Stir in the blueberries and lemon zest.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the cream and egg. Pour over the flour mixture. Mix together with your hands or a silicone spatula just until the mixture is mostly moistened (it should still be a little crumbly).</li>
    <li>Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead it gently a few times to shape it into a ball. Press the dough into an 8-inch circle. Cut into 8 wedges.</li>
    <li>Place wedges on a small parchment or silicone-lined baking sheet and freeze for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 205C.</li>
    <li>Transfer scones to a large baking sheet, placing them about 2 inches apart. Brush lightly with more cream and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
    <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are lightly browned and the bottom edges are golden. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
