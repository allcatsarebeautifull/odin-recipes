<h2>Description</h2>


These soft and tender pumpkin muffins come together in just a few minutes and will stay soft for days! They're perfectly sweet, loaded with all your favorite fall spices, and of course lots of pumpkin flavor.

<p>
    These pumpkin muffins are a perfect fall treat but I make them ALL YEAR round. I love the spices and melt in your mouth texture, they’re really the perfect breakfast treat or perfect snack. If you’re in the mood for more pumpkin breakfast recipes, then try out my baked pumpkin donuts or pumpkin scones.
